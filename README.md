Stock Price Prediction Using Python &amp; Machine Learning (LSTM)

Predictive analytics is the use of data, combined with techniques from matematics and statistics and computer science
to make predictions about future.
The goal of predictiove analytics is to produce a good assessment of what may happen with unknown events.

Here predictive analytics is done with machine learning. That is a sub-field of computer science. In general
the field can be simply described as 'given the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.'

Here we use machine learning techniques (LSTM) to predict future movements of Apple stock prices.
